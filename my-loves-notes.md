Thanks so much, my love!  This is looking GREAT so far!  Since it's a PDF, your love is going to jot her comments in this email instead of on the document.  I love you sooooo much!

The formatting is so cute and original.  I love my love's creative flair.  I do think your job titles at CNE could stand out a bit more, though?  The difference in font is a bit subtle, so maybe keep the font consistent with the job/project descriptions, but consider setting off the titles with bold face?  In general, I might try a more consistent font throughout, or using one font for big headers (e.g. Technical Experience, Skills), and one consistent font for the rest.

I would list your titles starting with the most recent.  Here is your love's suggestion for the overview of your trajectory at CNE.

Technical Architect (2016 - Present)
-Defined [architected?] high-level design for all new software projects and liaised with engineering and project managers to [facilitate implementation] [determine project timelines]
-Continued substantial individual contributions to javascript and ruby codebases

Full-Stack Software Engineer (2014 - 2016)
-Helped create an open and collaborative culture of clean, optimized, and performant code
-Gained expertise with Ember JS, overseeing not sure what to say here, but maybe something other than "resident expert"?
-Helped manage relationship with THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS

PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:

Looks great!  I'd add hyphens on "end-to-end" under the CMS description.

Small typo on "Other projects" (you typed "Others")

INDEPENDENT WEB DEVELOPER:

I'd add a hyphen for "Back- and front-end..."

SKILLS:

Maybe say "programming languages" instead of just "languages," (there aren't any foreign languages on your resume, but it's still useful to specify)

TECHNICAL SPEAKING:

X I'd list these in reverse chronological order.

X The scene postmortem: I'd say, "Presented with a colleague" instead of "spoke with a colleague," because the latter sounds like you had a one-on-one conversation

X Where you include demos, I'd be consistent about the format  (demo: LINK), rather than (demo can be found at...)

Could you add voice-overs to the resume?  I'm not exactly sure where.  Maybe under "other experience," and include links?

I might only include Full-Stack Software Developer (or Engineer, whichever you prefer) at the top of the resume, and leave the other TALENTS to the section at the bottom.  They are CUTE, but not as immediately relevant for someone just glancing at the resume?  Up to you, but I'd err on the side of a more focused first page.

That's all she can come up with for now!  Your love loves you soooooo much!  This is all so cute and wonderful!  My love is sooooo talented and special!
